      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Ryan, currently a junior at Western Washington University
          majoring in Computer Science. My passion for Computer Science
          sparked during my high school days when I took AP CS, and since
          then it has only grown as I delve further into the field. Lately,
          as I've progressed into major courses and become more active on
          campus, my focus has revolved around front-end design, including
          HTML and React, as well as object-oriented design using Java.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          While I spend a lot of my time on computer science related topics,
          I like to try and lead a balanced life. Some of my hobbies
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Playing board games: My deep interest in board games has driven
            me to design one with friends during high school. This passion
            often inspires me to undertake related projects, as board games
            provide intriguing opportunities for computer science
            applications. I am eager to continue designing and creating more
            board games in the future!
          </li>
          <li>
            Spending time outdoors: To take breaks and rejuvenate, I enjoy
            venturing outdoors. Going on hikes and spending quality time
            with others amidst nature are some of my favorite ways to unwind
            and appreciate the world around me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Working out: Since highschool, I have made significant efforts
            to lead a healthier lifestyle. Regular workouts have become an
            essential part of my routine, as they not only contribute to my
            well-being but also provide a mental escape and valuable
            personal time.

      <h3>Weather-App</h3>
      To enhance my proficiency in web development and React, I focused on a
      project to design a weather data application. Initially, I leveraged the
      <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank" class="text-link">OpenWeatherMap</a>
      API to access global weather data for cities around the world.
      Simultaneously, I accessed data from
      <a href="http://www.geonames.org/" target="_blank" class="text-link">GeoNames</a>
      , which supplied a comprehensive text file containing the names of
      cities worldwide with populations of at least 15,000. From here I parsed
      the file to extract pertinent data and constructed the list of cities
      that users can select for weather information. Given the vast amount of
      initial data, I implemented a filtering mechanism, resulting in the
      creation of a refined city list. This curated list exclusively included
      cities with populations of at least 85,000, optimizing the user
      experience. Furthermore, I employed virtualization techniques to enhance
      the application's loading speed, ensuring swift and seamless
      interactions. Throughout the development process, I utilized conditional
      rendering to mitigate unnecessary resource consumption. Finally, I
      deployed the application using Firebase, making it accessible to anyone
      <a href="https://weather-application-4245c.web.app/" target="_blank" class="text-link">here</a>. This project
      served as a valuable opportunity to expand my skill set,
      encompassing API integration, data parsing, performance optimization,
      and deployment, culminating in a functional and efficient weather data
      application.

      <h3>Pente</h3>
      Pente is an abstract strategy game for two players, bearing many
      similarities to the popular game Go. In Pente, players take turns
      placing stones onto a grid, aiming to achieve either five stones in a
      row or capture five pairs of their opponents' stones for victory. For
      this project, I initially implemented Pente in Java as a
      text-user-interface. It served as an excellent starting point to build
      my foundational Java skills while providing a project to showcase. As I
      pushed further into my programming journey, I embraced React and saw an
      opportunity to take my Pente project to the next level. I recreated the
      entire game as a graphical-user-interface through React JSX, elevating
      the game's presentation and accessibility. Moreover, I enhanced the
      game's playability by adding restart and undo functionalities. These
      features allow players to modify the game state by resetting the board
      or undoing their moves, contributing to a more engaging and enjoyable
      experience. Most recently I utilized Firebase to host the app, allowing
      anyone to play it
      <a href="https://pente-31410.web.app/" target="_blank" class="text-link">here</a>. Pente has been an invaluable
      project in bolstering my programming
      abilities, and serves as a testament to my progress in recent months.

      <h3>Deadwood</h3>
      In this project, my partner and I collaborated to implement a board game
      called Deadwood in Java. We began by creating a text-user-interface and
      later expanded it to include a graphical-user-interface using JavaFX.
      Our work on the GUI involved leveraging JavaFX to deliver a seamless
      user experience. Throughout the project, we practiced essential design
      patterns like singleton, adapter, and observer, while honing our
      teamwork abilities. Deadwood proved to be a significant catalyst for
      enhancing my coding skills, as it reinforced crucial object-oriented
      design principles, including SOLID principles. To ensure a comprehensive
      approach, we created complete use-case diagrams, write-ups, sequence
      diagrams, and class responsibility diagrams. A notable part of this
      project was developing an XML Parser that converted XML data into game
      objects. Overall, the project was both interesting and enjoyable,
      especially given my passion for board games.

      <h3>Racket Parser & Evaluator</h3>
      This project was a part of Formal Languages and Functional Programming
      (CS301) and aimed to create a parser and evaluator working together to
      evaluate expressions in the procedure-first format utilized by Racket.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initially, I developed an evaluator capable of handling various
          operations, from simple ones like addition, subtraction,
          multiplication, and division, to more complex ones like
          conditionals, mapping, and even lambdas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Following the evaluator's creation, I created a parser that could
          parse strings using a context-free grammar to properly format the
          equations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The parser provided the formatted equations to the evaluator which
          would then map the characters to functions and process them to reach
          a final answer.
        </li>
      </ul>
