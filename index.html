          <div class="content">
            <p>
              I'm Ryan and I'm a sophmore at Western Washington University
              majoring in Computer Science. I've been interested in Computer
              Science since I took AP CS in highschool, and my interest has
              continued to grow as I delve deeper into the field. Recently as I
              have begun to take major courses and get more involved on campus
              my interests have been centered around front end design, with
              things like HTML and React, as well as object oriented design with
              java.
            </p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              While I spend a lot of my time on computer science related topics,
              I like to try and keep a balanced life. Some of my hobbies
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Playing board games: For a long time I've been heavily invested
                in board games, and have even designed a board game with friends
                during highschool. My interest in board games often leads me to
                make projects related to them, furthered by the fact that board
                games often create interesting computer science projects. I plan
                to design and create more in the future!
              </li>
              <li>
                Spending time outdoors: I like taking breaks by getting outside.
                Spending time outdoors with others and going on hikes are some
                of my favorite ways to get out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Working out: Since my sophmore year in college I've spent a lot
                of time and effort making my lifestyle more healthy. One of the
                core ways I've gone about this is by working out regularly. I
                like the way it clears my mind and gives me time to myself.

        <h3>Racket Parser & Evaluator</h3>
        This project was a part of Formal Languages and Functional Programming
        (CS301). The goal was to create a parser and an evaluator that could
        work in tandem to evaluate expressions in the procedure first format
        utilized by Racket. First, I had to create a parser that could parse
        strings using a context-free-grammar. From this point I created an
        evaluator that could take the formatted equations from parser, and get
        the answer. The evaluator has the capacity of handling simple operations
        such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as well as
        more complex operations such as conditionals, mapping, and even lambdas.

        example inputs and expected outputs.

        <h3>Deadwood</h3>
        In this project, I worked with a partner to implement a boardgame called
        Deadwood in java. First as a text user interface, and then as a graphic
        user interface. We handled the GUI portion with the use of javaFX. The
        project required us to practice many important and common design
        patterns such as singleton, adapter, and observer design patterns.
        Deadwood significantly strengthed my coding skills while enforing
        crucial object oriented design principles, including SOLID principles.
        As part of this project I had to create an XML Parser to turn data from
        XML format into game objects, which was another skill I was happy to
        pick up. Overall the project was interesting and enjoyable, especially
        due to my interest in board games.

        <h3>Pente</h3>
        This project is a work in progress. Pente is a two player abstract
        strategy game, with many similarities to the popular game Go. In Pente
        players take turn placing stones onto a grid, attempting to either get
        five in a row, or capture five pairs of their opponents stones. For this
        project I first implemented Pente in java as a text-user-interface, then
        as a graphic-user-interface using javascript/react. Pente is a fairly
        straightforwards game and I used it as an early project to help build my
        base java skills, as well as get a start to projects I can showcase. I
        plan to create a functional adaption of my pente project using React in
        the future.
